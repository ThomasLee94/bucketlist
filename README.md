# BucketList

A platform to allow only Locals to post about their activities in their area for Travelers to see.

* A more detailed write up is in progress *

A wireframe for what the web app will look like can be found under the following links:

## Setup
- Clone the repo:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/ThomasLee94/bucketlist.git
  ```
- Run npm install.
  ```
  cd bucketlist
  npm install
  ```

## Features
- Users can drop pins in a location using coordinates (Mapbox API)
- Users must "apply" to prove they know what they are endorsing.
- Users can only endorse others for a skill they have applied and have been accepted for. 

## Backlog

- There will be user differentiation between Locals and Travelers, eventually only Locals will be able to drop pings.
- Fully interactable map (no need for a seperate form to manually add activities). Locals will eventually be able directly drop pins and add a quick description from the map.
- Travelers will be able to leave comments under activities.
- Activities will have an upvote system.
- Emphasis on a mobile app.
